# Trips

## Selecting schedules
The schedule editor allows users to create trips/frequencies for any route, pattern, and calendar combination.  The selectors at the top of the page allow users to navigate between calendars for a given pattern or switch between patterns for a route or even routes within the feed.

Each selection has a set of statistics associated with it to give you a sense of how it fits in with the feed:

- **Route**
    - \# of trips for the entire route
- **Pattern**
    - \# of trips for pattern
    - \# of calendars containing these trips.
- **Calendar**
    - \# of trips for selected pattern / \# of trips for entire route
    - \# of routes with trips in calendar
    - \# of trips in calendar for entire feed
